Suppose we have an input batch of 16 episodes of image samples, with each episode being of equal length of 50. Based on the design of the rest of the project (which we have already implemented for you), MANNCell should be called 50 times, each time having 16 input samples (along with the offseted labels), and outputting 16 output labels. More specifically, the MANNCell should produce classification labels $[\\hat{y}_0^t, ..., \\hat{y}_{15}^t]$ for all 16 iteration-$t$ image samples batch $[x^t_0+\\text{null}, x^t_1+y_0^t, ..., x^t_{15}+y_{14}^t]$ (\"+\" means concatenation) every time it is called; for your information, it is the class NTMOneShotLearningModel (already implemented below) that actually calls MANNCell 50 times. Your job is to make sure that at a single iteration $t$ (where $t=0,1,2,...,49$), MANNCell correctly parses the input arguments, produce the correct read and write weights $w^r_t, w^w_t$, correctly retrieve from and write to the memory to form $M_t$, and use the right material to get the logits for classification (they will be used for computing the labels and cross-entropy values in NTMOneShotLearningModel), and return the right states that will be used in the next iteration $t+1$. \n",
